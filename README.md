One of the features that I'm most proud of in my code is the navigation system. It lets the user switch between different home screens with ease and explore the online store. I think this makes the user experience more engaging and fun, as they can discover new products and offers. I also like how I organized the code to make it easy to read and modify. I used clear names for the variables and functions, and added comments to explain the logic behind each step.
